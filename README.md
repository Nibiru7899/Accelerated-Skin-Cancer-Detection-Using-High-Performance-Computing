* **MPI (Message Passing Interface):** For inter-node communication and distributing the workload across the cluster.
* **OpenMP (Open Multi-Processing):** For intra-node, shared-memory parallelism across multiple CPU cores during data preprocessing.
* **CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture):** For massively parallel acceleration of deep learning and feature extraction tasks on NVIDIA GPUs.
